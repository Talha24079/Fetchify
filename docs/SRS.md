## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Fetchify is a standalone desktop application built with C# in Visual Studio. It uses `aria2` as its core downloading engine and interacts with it through system calls. The application processes the output from `aria2` to display progress and control operations within its GUI.

### 2.2 Product Features

- Add, pause, resume, and cancel downloads
- Schedule downloads by date and time
- Categorize downloads into user-defined folders
- Track download history and status logs
- Display download speed, progress bar, ETA
- Speed limiter for bandwidth control

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

| User Type       | Characteristics                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Casual Users    | Basic users looking for GUI download control  |
| Advanced Users  | Comfortable with configuring download options |

### 2.4 Operating Environment

- Platform: Windows 10 / 11  
- Framework: .NET 6 or later  
- Dependency: `aria2c` must be available in system PATH or bundled with application  

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- Must interface correctly with `aria2` using standard input/output
- Application must remain compliant with GPL v3 licensing
- Cross-platform support is not a priority in the initial release

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Internet connection is required for downloading
- Compatible version of `aria2` is present on the system
